Tic Toe game made with Node.js and TypeScript - **The TIK TOK Game**

---

### HOW TO SET UP
`npm install`

---

### HOW TO RUN
`npm start`

---

### HOW TO DEVELOP
`npm run dev`

In a second terminal, run  `npm start`. 

Due to a limitation in the **prompt-sync** lib used to capture answers, isn't possible to use **nodemon** or similars to watch files compiled from TS on `./dist` folder to restart Node.js.
